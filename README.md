# 🌊 Power BI Wavy Animation Backgrounds (No Title)

Two CSS-only, title-free background animations for Power BI **HTML Viewer** visuals or standalone HTML use.  
Each creates smooth, rotating “liquid-wave” effects for transitions or splash pages.

- **Dark Blue Version** – ocean tones, dark centre glow  
- **Fire Version** – warm red/orange tones, dark centre glow  

Both are JavaScript-free and run entirely with CSS keyframes.

## 🧩 How to Use in Power BI
1. Import an **HTML Viewer** visual (e.g. “HTML Content”).
2. Create a new **measure** and paste one of the DAX snippets:
   - `WavyBlueDark`
   - `WavyFireDark`
3. Place the visual and bind the measure.
4. Resize to full-page for the best immersive effect.

Inspired by the CodePen **[“Wavy Animation” by Porsake](https://codepen.io/porsake/pen/JjydjLz)**.  
Adapted and restyled for Power BI and GitHub by **Guy Orlov**.  

> The concept uses rotating rounded shapes (`border-radius`) over layered gradients to simulate wave motion.  
> This adaptation adds dark-centre gradients and simplified inline CSS for Power BI HTML rendering.
